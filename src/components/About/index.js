                Hello, and thank you for visiting my portfolio. My name is Alex McDaniel, and if you are here then I am seeking meaningful, long term employment! 
                I am a junior full stack web developer looking for my first development job. I have experience in many areas but I also have very much to learn.
                I love to keep learning new things, improving however I can. I am a self motivated worker and learner, and I pick up on new things very quickly.
            </p>
