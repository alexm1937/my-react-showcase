                Hello, and thank you for visiting my portfolio. <br></br> 
                My name is Alex McDaniel, and I am currently seeking meaningful, long term employment! <br></br> 
                <br></br> 
                I am an aspirings junior full stack web developer looking for my first development job. I have experience in many areas, but I also have very much to learn.
                I am primarily experienced in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git/Github. Including add-ons and libraries such as Bootrap, Tailwind, Jquery, Node, Express and more, 
                as well as full stacks using mySQL, RESTful API's and MongoDB MERN stack. <br></br> 
                <br></br> 

                I love to stay learning new things, improving however I can. I am a self motivated worker and learner.
